# Enchanted Roots

## Description of Game
Enchanted Roots is an educational point and click game where you play as a cat navigating the mystical Enchanted Forest. With the help of a magical talking bee, players assist the trees against the infestation, exploring the fundamental concepts of Binary Search Trees (BSTs). Using intuitive point-and-click interactions, players learn to insert, search, and delete nodes from trees to restore balance to the forest. Enchanted Roots blends gentle music, whimsical storytelling, and structured computer science concepts into an accessible experience for learners of all levels.
